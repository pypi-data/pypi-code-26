class DiGraph(Graph):
    """
    Base class for directed graphs.

    A DiGraph stores nodes and edges with optional data, or attributes.

    DiGraphs hold directed edges.  Self loops are allowed but multiple
    (parallel) edges are not.

    Nodes can be arbitrary (hashable) Python objects with optional
    key/value attributes. By convention `None` is not used as a node.

    Edges are represented as links between nodes with optional
    key/value attributes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    incoming_graph_data : input graph (optional, default: None)
        Data to initialize graph. If None (default) an empty
        graph is created.  The data can be any format that is supported
        by the to_cynetworkx_graph() function, currently including edge list,
        dict of dicts, dict of lists, NetworkX graph, NumPy matrix
        or 2d ndarray, SciPy sparse matrix, or PyGraphviz graph.

    attr : keyword arguments, optional (default= no attributes)
        Attributes to add to graph as key=value pairs.

    See Also
    --------

    MultiGraph
    MultiDiGraph
    OrderedDiGraph

    Examples
    --------
    Create an empty graph structure (a "null graph") with no nodes and
    no edges.

    >>> G = nx.DiGraph()

    G can be grown in several ways.

    **Nodes:**

    Add one node at a time:

    >>> G.add_node(1)

    Add the nodes from any container (a list, dict, set or
    even the lines from a file or the nodes from another graph).

    >>> G.add_nodes_from([2, 3])
    >>> G.add_nodes_from(range(100, 110))
    >>> H = nx.path_graph(10)
    >>> G.add_nodes_from(H)

    In addition to strings and integers any hashable Python object
    (except None) can represent a node, e.g. a customized node object,
    or even another Graph.

    >>> G.add_node(H)

    **Edges:**

    G can also be grown by adding edges.

    Add one edge,

    >>> G.add_edge(1, 2)

    a list of edges,

    >>> G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3)])

    or a collection of edges,

    >>> G.add_edges_from(H.edges)

    If some edges connect nodes not yet in the graph, the nodes
    are added automatically.  There are no errors when adding
    nodes or edges that already exist.

    **Attributes:**

    Each graph, node, and edge can hold key/value attribute pairs
    in an associated attribute dictionary (the keys must be hashable).
    By default these are empty, but can be added or changed using
    add_edge, add_node or direct manipulation of the attribute
    dictionaries named graph, node and edge respectively.

    >>> G = nx.DiGraph(day="Friday")
    >>> G.graph
    {'day': 'Friday'}

    Add node attributes using add_node(), add_nodes_from() or G.nodes

    >>> G.add_node(1, time='5pm')
    >>> G.add_nodes_from([3], time='2pm')
    >>> G.nodes[1]
    {'time': '5pm'}
    >>> G.nodes[1]['room'] = 714
    >>> del G.nodes[1]['room'] # remove attribute
    >>> list(G.nodes(data=True))
    [(1, {'time': '5pm'}), (3, {'time': '2pm'})]

    Add edge attributes using add_edge(), add_edges_from(), subscript
    notation, or G.edges.

    >>> G.add_edge(1, 2, weight=4.7 )
    >>> G.add_edges_from([(3, 4), (4, 5)], color='red')
    >>> G.add_edges_from([(1, 2, {'color':'blue'}), (2, 3, {'weight':8})])
    >>> G[1][2]['weight'] = 4.7
    >>> G.edges[1, 2]['weight'] = 4

    Warning: we protect the graph data structure by making `G.edges[1, 2]` a
    read-only dict-like structure. However, you can assign to attributes
    in e.g. `G.edges[1, 2]`. Thus, use 2 sets of brackets to add/change
    data attributes: `G.edges[1, 2]['weight'] = 4`
    (For multigraphs: `MG.edges[u, v, key][name] = value`).

    **Shortcuts:**

    Many common graph features allow python syntax to speed reporting.

    >>> 1 in G     # check if node in graph
    True
    >>> [n for n in G if n < 3]  # iterate through nodes
    [1, 2]
    >>> len(G)  # number of nodes in graph
    5

    Often the best way to traverse all edges of a graph is via the neighbors.
    The neighbors are reported as an adjacency-dict `G.adj` or as `G.adjacency()`

    >>> for n, nbrsdict in G.adjacency():
    ...     for nbr, eattr in nbrsdict.items():
    ...        if 'weight' in eattr:
    ...            # Do something useful with the edges
    ...            pass

    But the edges reporting object is often more convenient:

    >>> for u, v, weight in G.edges(data='weight'):
    ...     if weight is not None:
    ...         # Do something useful with the edges
    ...         pass

    **Reporting:**

    Simple graph information is obtained using object-attributes and methods.
    Reporting usually provides views instead of containers to reduce memory
    usage. The views update as the graph is updated similarly to dict-views.
    The objects `nodes, `edges` and `adj` provide access to data attributes
    via lookup (e.g. `nodes[n], `edges[u, v]`, `adj[u][v]`) and iteration
    (e.g. `nodes.items()`, `nodes.data('color')`,
    `nodes.data('color', default='blue')` and similarly for `edges`)
    Views exist for `nodes`, `edges`, `neighbors()`/`adj` and `degree`.

    For details on these and other miscellaneous methods, see below.

    **Subclasses (Advanced):**

    The Graph class uses a dict-of-dict-of-dict data structure.
    The outer dict (node_dict) holds adjacency information keyed by node.
    The next dict (adjlist_dict) represents the adjacency information and holds
    edge data keyed by neighbor.  The inner dict (edge_attr_dict) represents
    the edge data and holds edge attribute values keyed by attribute names.

    Each of these three dicts can be replaced in a subclass by a user defined
    dict-like object. In general, the dict-like features should be
    maintained but extra features can be added. To replace one of the
    dicts create a new graph class by changing the class(!) variable
    holding the factory for that dict-like structure. The variable names are
    node_dict_factory, adjlist_inner_dict_factory, adjlist_outer_dict_factory,
    and edge_attr_dict_factory.

    node_dict_factory : function, (default: dict)
        Factory function to be used to create the dict containing node
        attributes, keyed by node id.
        It should require no arguments and return a dict-like object

    adjlist_outer_dict_factory : function, (default: dict)
        Factory function to be used to create the outer-most dict
        in the data structure that holds adjacency info keyed by node.
        It should require no arguments and return a dict-like object.

    adjlist_inner_dict_factory : function, optional (default: dict)
        Factory function to be used to create the adjacency list
        dict which holds edge data keyed by neighbor.
        It should require no arguments and return a dict-like object

    edge_attr_dict_factory : function, optional (default: dict)
        Factory function to be used to create the edge attribute
        dict which holds attrbute values keyed by attribute name.
        It should require no arguments and return a dict-like object.

    Examples
    --------

    Create a low memory graph class that effectively disallows edge
    attributes by using a single attribute dict for all edges.
    This reduces the memory used, but you lose edge attributes.

    >>> class ThinGraph(nx.Graph):
    ...     all_edge_dict = {'weight': 1}
    ...     def single_edge_dict(self):
    ...         return self.all_edge_dict
    ...     edge_attr_dict_factory = single_edge_dict
    >>> G = ThinGraph()
    >>> G.add_edge(2, 1)
    >>> G[2][1]
    {'weight': 1}
    >>> G.add_edge(2, 2)
    >>> G[2][1] is G[2][2]
    True


    Please see :mod:`~cynetworkx.classes.ordered` for more examples of
    creating graph subclasses by overwriting the base class `dict` with
    a dictionary-like object.

        Notes
        -----
        Adding an edge that already exists updates the edge data.

        Many NetworkX algorithms designed for weighted graphs use
        an edge attribute (by default `weight`) to hold a numerical value.

        Examples
        --------
        The following all add the edge e=(1, 2) to graph G:

        >>> G = nx.Graph()   # or DiGraph, MultiGraph, MultiDiGraph, etc
        >>> e = (1, 2)
        >>> G.add_edge(1, 2)           # explicit two-node form

        >>> G.add_edges_from( [(1, 2)] ) # add edges from iterable container

        Associate data to edges using keywords:

        >>> G.add_edge(1, 2, weight=3)
        >>> G.add_edge(1, 3, weight=7, capacity=15, length=342.7)

        For non-string attribute keys, use subscript notation.

        The copy method by default returns a shallow copy of the graph
        and attributes. That is, if an attribute is a container, that
        container is shared by the original an the copy.
        Use Python's `copy.deepcopy` for new containers.

        If `as_view` is True then a view is returned instead of a copy.

        Notes
        -----
        All copies reproduce the graph structure, but data attributes
        may be handled in different ways. There are four types of copies
        of a graph that people might want.

        Deepcopy -- The default behavior is a "deepcopy" where the graph
        structure as well as all data attributes and any objects they might
        contain are copied. The entire graph object is new so that changes
        in the copy do not affect the original object. (see Python's
        copy.deepcopy)

        Data Reference (Shallow) -- For a shallow copy the graph structure
        is copied but the edge, node and graph attribute dicts are
        references to those in the original graph. This saves
        time and memory but could cause confusion if you change an attribute
        in one graph and it changes the attribute in the other.
        NetworkX does not provide this level of shallow copy.

        Independent Shallow -- This copy creates new independent attribute
        dicts and then does a shallow copy of the attributes. That is, any
        attributes that are containers are shared between the new graph
        and the original. This is exactly what `dict.copy()` provides.
        You can obtain this style copy using:

            >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)
            >>> H = G.copy()
            >>> H = G.copy(as_view=False)
            >>> H = nx.Graph(G)
            >>> H = G.fresh_copy().__class__(G)

        Fresh Data -- For fresh data, the graph structure is copied while
        new empty data attribute dicts are created. The resulting graph
        is independent of the original and it has no edge, node or graph
        attributes. Fresh copies are not enabled. Instead use:

            >>> H = G.fresh_copy()
            >>> H.add_nodes_from(G)
            >>> H.add_edges_from(G.edges)

        View -- Inspired by dict-views, graph-views act like read-only
        versions of the original graph, providing a copy of the original
        structure without requiring any memory for copying the information.

        See the Python copy module for more information on shallow
        and deep copies, https://docs.python.org/2/library/copy.html.

        Parameters
        ----------
        as_view : bool, optional (default=False)
            If True, the returned graph-view provides a read-only view
            of the original graph without actually copying any data.

        Returns
        -------
        G : Graph
            A copy of the graph.

        --------

        Parameters
        ----------
        reciprocal : bool (optional)
          If True only keep edges that appear in both directions
          in the original digraph.
        as_view : bool (optional, default=False)
          If True return an undirected view of the original directed graph.

        Returns
        -------
        G : Graph
            An undirected graph with the same name and nodes and
            with edge (u, v, data) if either (u, v, data) or (v, u, data)
            is in the digraph.  If both edges exist in digraph and
            their edge data is different, only one edge is created
            with an arbitrary choice of which edge data to use.
            You must check and correct for this manually if desired.

        See Also
        --------
        Graph, copy, add_edge, add_edges_from

        Notes
        -----
        If edges in both directions (u, v) and (v, u) exist in the
        graph, attributes for the new undirected edge will be a combination of
        the attributes of the directed edges.  The edge data is updated
        in the (arbitrary) order that the edges are encountered.  For
        more customized control of the edge attributes use add_edge().

        This returns a "deepcopy" of the edge, node, and
        graph attributes which attempts to completely copy
        all of the data and references.

        This is in contrast to the similar G=DiGraph(D) which returns a
        shallow copy of the data.

        See the Python copy module for more information on shallow
        and deep copies, https://docs.python.org/2/library/copy.html.

        Warning: If you have subclassed DiGraph to use dict-like objects
        in the data structure, those changes do not transfer to the
        Graph created by this method.

        The graph, edge and node attributes are shared with the original graph.
